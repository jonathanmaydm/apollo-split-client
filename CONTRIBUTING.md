## Semantic Versioning
Apollo Split Client follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for bugfixes, minor versions for new features, and major versions for any breaking changes. Please note the version bump and respective changes in your pull request.

## Bugs
If there are any bugs to report, please open an issue on GitHub and tag it as a bug. The more detail that can be provided, the better (how to reproduce, error or warning messages, etc.).

## Proposing a Change
For changes to the core functionality, please open an issue before creating a pull request. This will allow us to review your proposal and open a discussion concerning the changes.

If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing. This is helpful in case we don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.
